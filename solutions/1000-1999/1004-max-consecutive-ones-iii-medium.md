# 1004 - Max Consecutive Ones III (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `0 <= k <= nums.length`
