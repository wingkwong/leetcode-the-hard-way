# 1655 - Distribute Repeating Integers (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-repeating-integers/

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, where there are at most `50` unique values in the array. You are also given an array of `m` customer order quantities, `quantity`, where `quantity[i]` is the amount of integers the `ith` customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute `nums` such that:

- The `ith` customer gets **exactly** `quantity[i]` integers,
- The integers the `ith` customer gets are **all equal**, and
- Every customer is satisfied.

Return `true` _if it is possible to distribute_ `nums` _according to the above conditions_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], quantity = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: The 0th customer cannot be given two different integers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], quantity = [2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [3,3]. The integers [1,2] are not used.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], quantity = [2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The 0th customer is given [1,1], and the 1st customer is given [2,2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `m == quantity.length`
- `1 <= m <= 10`
- `1 <= quantity[i] <= 10^5`
- There are at most `50` unique values in `nums`.
