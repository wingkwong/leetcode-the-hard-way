# 2839 - Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations I (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-strings-can-be-made-equal-with-operations-i/

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `4`, consisting of **lowercase** English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings **any** number of times:

- Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `j - i = 2`, then **swap** the two characters at those indices in the string.

Return `true`_if you can make the strings_`s1`_and_`s2`_equal, and_`false`_otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
Output: true
Explanation: We can do the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbad".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 3. The resulting string is s1 = "cdab" = s2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dacb"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.
```

**Constraints:**

- `s1.length == s2.length == 4`
- `s1` and `s2` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

Since we have 4 characters and given we can only swap `s1[i]` and `s1[j]` where `j - i = 2`, we can brute force the solution by checking two cases. If $s1[0]$ is not same as $s2[0]$, we can only swap $s1[0]$ and $s1[2]$. Similarly, we perform the same logic on $s1[1]$ and compare $s1$ and $s2$ at the end.

class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        if (s1[0] ^ s2[0]) swap(s1[0], s1[2]);
        if (s1[1] ^ s2[1]) swap(s1[1], s1[3]);
        return s1 == s2;
    }
};
```
