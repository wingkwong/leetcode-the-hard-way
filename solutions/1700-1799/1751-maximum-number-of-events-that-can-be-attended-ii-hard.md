# 1751 - Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60048-pm.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.
```

**Example 3:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png" alt="" data-size="original"/>

```
Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= events.length`
- `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6`
- `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9`
- `1 <= valuei <= 10^6`

## Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        int n = events.size();
        // sort by start time
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        // dp[i][j] means the max value we could get
        // when we are at event i with k events left to join
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(k + 1, -1));
        function<int(int,int,int)> dfs = [&](int idx, int k, int end) {
            // reached all events or attended all k events
            if (idx == n || k == 0) return 0;
            // current start time <= previous end time
            // cannot attend -> move to the next one
            if (events[idx][0] <= end) return dfs(idx + 1, k, end);
            // calculated before - return it immediately
            if (dp[idx][k] != -1) return dp[idx][k];
            // so we only have two choices left, we either
            return dp[idx][k] = max(
                // choice 1: attend this event
                // and search for the next events starting from this end time
                events[idx][2] + dfs(idx + 1, k - 1, events[idx][1]),
                // choice 2: skip this event - search for the next one
                dfs(idx + 1, k, end)
            );
        };
        return dfs(0, k, 0);
    }
};
```
