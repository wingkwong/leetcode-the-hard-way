# 1704 - Determine if String Halves Are Alike (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are **alike** if they have the same number of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return `true`_if_`a`_and_`b`\*are **alike\***. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s.length` is even.
- `s` consists of **uppercase and lowercase** letters.

## Approach 1: Counting

Well, just count the vowels in each half and compare. Using string_view avoids make a copy of the input.

Clang seems to produce fairly efficient code for isVowel: https://godbolt.org/z/MWra5vb6G -- much shorter than I though it would be and branch-free. @jit posted a nice analysis about the generated code [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/solutions/2865500/c-counting-vowels-and-looking-at-some-assembly/comments/1702118).

- Time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the
- Space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
