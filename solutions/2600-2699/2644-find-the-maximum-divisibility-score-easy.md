# 2644 - Find the Maximum Divisibility Score (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-divisibility-score/

## Problem Statement

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`.

The **divisibility score** of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices `j` such that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`.

Return _the integer_ `divisors[i]` _with the maximum divisibility score_. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 5.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since nums[0] is divisible by 2.
The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3], and nums[4] are divisible by 3.
Since divisors[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [5,7,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 7.
The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
Since divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[2] all have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[2]).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [12], divisors = [10,16]
Output: 10
Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 10.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 16.
Since divisors[0] and divisors[1] both have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[0]).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= 10^9`

                ans = d;
            } else if (cnt == mx_cnt) {
                // however, if the counter is same as the current max
                // then we need to take the min one
                ans = min(ans, d);
            }
        }
        return ans;
