# 2678 - Number of Senior Citizens (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/

## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `details`. Each element of `details` provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length `15`. The system is such that:

- The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
- The next character denotes the gender of the person.
- The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
- The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.

Return _the number of passengers who are **strictly\*\***more than 60 years old\*\*._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]
Output: 2
Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: details = ["1313579440F2036","2921522980M5644"]
Output: 0
Explanation: None of the passengers are older than 60.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= details.length <= 100`
- `details[i].length == 15`
- `details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.`
- `details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.`
- The phone numbers and seat numbers of the passengers are distinct.

## Approach 1: Extract The Number

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">
<SolutionAuthor name="@wkw"/>

```py
class Solution:
    def countSeniors(self, details: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for detail in details:
            # just check if the age is strictly more than 60 years old
            if int(detail[11:13]) > 60:
                res += 1
        return res

```
