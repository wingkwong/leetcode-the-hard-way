# 2614 - Prime In Diagonal (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-in-diagonal/

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed two-dimensional integer array `nums`.

Return _the largest **prime** number that lies on at least one of the **diagonals** of_`nums`. In case, no prime is present on any of the diagonals, _return 0._

Note that:

- An integer is **prime** if it is greater than `1` and has no positive integer divisors other than `1` and itself.
- An integer `val` is on one of the**diagonals** of `nums` if there exists an integer `i` for which `nums[i][i] = val` or an `i` for which `nums[i][nums.length - i - 1]= val`.

In the above diagram, one diagonal is **[1,5,9]** and another diagonal is**[3,5,7]**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,6,7],[9,10,11]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The numbers 1, 3, 6, 9, and 11 are the only numbers present on at least one of the diagonals. Since 11 is the largest prime, we return 11.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[5,17,7],[9,11,10]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The numbers 1, 3, 9, 10, and 17 are all present on at least one of the diagonals. 17 is the largest prime, so we return 17.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 300`
- `nums.length == numsi.length`
- `1 <= nums[i][j]Â <= 4 * 1e6`

class Solution {
public:
    int isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return 0;
        if (n <= 3) return 1;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return 0;
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i = i + 6) {
          if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) {
            return 0;
          }
        }
        return 1;
    }

    int diagonalPrime(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        int ans = 0, n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // check if the number on main diagonal is prime
            if (isPrime(nums[i][i])) ans = max(ans, nums[i][i]);
            // check if the number on anti diagonal is prime
            if (isPrime(nums[i][n - i - 1])) ans = max(ans, nums[i][n - i - 1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
