# 0706 - Design HashMap (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/

## Problem Statement

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the `MyHashMap` class:

* `MyHashMap()` initializes the object with an empty map.
* `void put(int key, int value)` inserts a `(key, value)` pair into the HashMap. If the `key` already exists in the map, update the corresponding `value`.
* `int get(int key)` returns the `value` to which the specified `key` is mapped, or `-1` if this map contains no mapping for the `key`.
* `void remove(key)` removes the `key` and its corresponding `value` if the map contains the mapping for the `key`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]
```


**Constraints:**

* `0 <= key, value <= 10^6`
* At most `10^4` calls will be made to `put`, `get`, and `remove`.

## Approach 1: With Array and LinkedList

Prerequisite: [HashMap](../../tutorials/basic-topics/hash-map)

As a problem stated, Design HashMap, but what is HashMap or HashTable ?

_A hash tables is a data structure that maps keys to values_ for highly efficient lookup (constant $O(1)$ time).

In this simple implementation, we use an array of linked lists and a hash code function to store the values.

**To Insert a key**,

* First, compute the key’s hash code, which will usually be an `int` or `long`.
* Then, map the hash code to an index in the array. Eg: `hash(key) % array_length`.
* _Store the key and value in this index_, we must use linked list because of collisions.

How can we design the HashMap which is similar to used in programming languages?

Few points to consider while designing the HashMap, 

* How to handle the collisions? Collision is if the same key is mapped to more than value. 
* HashMap should be efficient and should automatically grow and shrink in size. 

We will look at first, How to handle collisions. There are multiple ways of handling HashTable (HashMap) collision, here I have used Chaining with Linked Lists.

**Chaining with Linked Lists**

The hash table’s array maps to a linked list of items. We just add the items to this linked list. As long as the number of collisions is fairly small, this will be quite efficient.

In the worst case, lookup is $O(n)$, where the $n$ is the number of elements in the Linked List.

**Automatically increase and decrease in size**

Since internally, all `HashMap` implementation uses _array to store the values_. 

As we know array's can't be increase or decrease in size automatically, because once we initialize the array with a fixed size, the array is default to the size, until we re-assign the values with new array or re-initialize the array with the new size when program needs. 

But HashMap stores and operates thousands and millions of elements seamlessly with constant $O(1)$ time. As technically it's `amortized` constant $O(1)$ time. 

What is amortized time?

When the array in it has reached its capacity and need to re-create itself with the doubled size. The array has hit the capacity and we have no slots available. Then we need to create a brand new array with the doubled size. And then copy the items in the old one to the new one, which takes $O(n)$ where $n$ is the capacity of the old array and the worst case.

The implementation of HashMap increase / decrease in size happens in the below cases.

Initialize ListNode[] array with $16$, it's a default configuration used in languages. We can take other numbers as well, but it's a standard practise to initialize array capacity with $16$. 

The main reason for that, if the capacity is too low (less than $16$), we have to increase the size (grow our hashmap) immediately after few elements added to HashMap, this is not the best implementation. 

Here another important considerations is when to grow the table or double it's capacity? Since we cannot do that for every insert new element, so we it's better to keep some ranges like if the table reaches $50$% of capacity, or $75$% capacity or $90$%. As per language implementation is $75$%, so we follow the same here. 

The same goes for reduce or decrease HashMap when we remove elements. When the element size is reach $N/4$ capacity i.e, $25$%, we will reduce the capacity to half of the size. 

So HashMap Initial Capacity is set to $16$ and `Load Factor` is set to $75$%, As soon as the size reaches $75$%, Hashmap does table doubling and shrink automatically to $50$% when it reaches elements of size $25$%.

Let's consider, $m$ is the actual size of the elements in the ListNode array, and $n$ is the threshold range for the bucket capacity, when $m > n$, HashMap allocating the memory for $2*N$ elements and **rehasing the entire array for the newly allocated slots**.

If $n / 4$ size reached while removing elements, then Hashmap shrink it to $n / 2$ size.
