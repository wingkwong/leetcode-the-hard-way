# 0704 - Binary Search (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `-104 < nums[i], target < 104`
* All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is sorted in ascending order.


## Approach 1: Brute Force/Linear Search

The questions asks for an $$O(log n)$$ time answer. But what if we can't find that. We can always start with the brute force solution first to gain insight. Obviously we can imagine, that if we scan through the numbers, we can return it if we find it, and if we reach the end of the array without finding it, we can return -1. 

We also know the array is sorted, so if we ever pass the target before the end, we can return early. That is our insight right there. 

Time Complexity $$O(n)$$ to scan each number in the array.

Space Complexity $$O(1)$$

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # scan all numbers, tracking index, i and number, num.
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # if num == target, we found num, return index, i
            if num == target:
                return i
            # num > target, we passed it, we can return -1 early
            elif num > target:
                return -1
        # if we couldn't find it and couldn't return early, return -1.
        return -1
```

Note we found our insight above that the array is sorted. Since the array is sorted, and we know if the number we are looking at is larger or smaller than our target, then can we eliminate the need to look at all the numbers? Can we look directly in the middle, and eliminate half of all numbers in one go? We can. That is our intuition for binary search below.


## Approach 2: Binary Search

Prerequisite: [Binary Search](../../tutorials/basic-topics/binary-search)

We set the boundary from the first index to the last index of the array. In each round, we try the middle one $$m = l + (r - l + 1) / 2$$. The reason we add $$1$$ here is that we need to take the upper one if there are even number of elements. If the target is less than $$nums[m]$$, then move the right pointer to $$m - 1$$, else move the left pointer to $$m$$. At the end, if the target is found, the index would be $$l$$.

> How about taking the lower element if the number of elements is even?

Similarly, we set the boundary from the first index to the last index of the array. In each round, we try the middle one $$m = l + (r - l) / 2$$. If there are even number of elements, we take the lower one. If the target is greater than $$nums[m]$$, then move the left pointer to $$m + 1$$, else move the right pointer to $$m$$. At the end, if the target is found, the index would be $$l$$.
