# 1019 - Next Greater Node In Linked List (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/

## Problem Statement

You are given the `head` of a linked list with `n` nodes.

For each node in the list, find the value of the **next greater node**. That is, for each node, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has a **strictly larger** value than it.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the value of the next greater node of the `ith` node (**1-indexed**). If the `ith` node does not have a next greater node, set `answer[i] = 0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 1e4`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1e9`

## Approach 1: Stack

1. Initialize an empty stack and an empty answer vector.
2. Reverse the given linked list.
3. Traverse the reversed linked list.
4. For each node:
   - While the stack is not empty and the top element is less than or equal to the current node's value, pop elements from the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, append 0 to the answer vector.
   - If the stack is not empty, append the top element to the answer vector.
   - Push the current node's value onto the stack.
5. Reverse the answer vector to obtain the correct order of next larger elements.
6. Return the answer vector.

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as we use a stack to store elements and an answer vector to store the
