# 0202 - Happy Number (Easy)

## Problem Statement

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

* Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
* Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
* Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
