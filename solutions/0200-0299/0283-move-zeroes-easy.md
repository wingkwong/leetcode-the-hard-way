# 0283 - Move Zeroes (Easy)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
