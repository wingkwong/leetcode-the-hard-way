# 0429 - N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given an n-ary tree, return the _level order_ traversal of its nodes' values.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]
```

**Constraints:**

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
- The total number of nodes is between `[0, 104]`

## Approach 1: BFS
