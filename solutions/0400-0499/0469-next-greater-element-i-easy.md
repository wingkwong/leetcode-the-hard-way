# 0469 - Next Greater Element I (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/

## Problem Statement

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `nums1.length` _such that_ `ans[i]` _is the **next greater element** as described above._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`
* All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
* All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

## Approach 1: Hash Map + Stack

The first thing we need to do is to store the $$(value, index)$$ pair from `nums1` in a hash map.

Then we need to find the _next greater element_ of all elements in `nums2`. This can be achieved by using a stack. If the current element is greater than the last element of the stack, we know the next greater element of the last element of the stack is the current element. We can access the index of the last element of the stack with `hash_map` (if it exists). Then we can put the current\_element in result.

After processing `nums2`, we need to assign `-1` to the elements still in the stack (no _next greater element_) with the help of `hash_map`.

                index_in_nums1 = hash_map[remaining_number]
    
                #set its position in result to -1 (no greater element)
                result[index_in_nums1] = -1
        
        #return result
        return result
