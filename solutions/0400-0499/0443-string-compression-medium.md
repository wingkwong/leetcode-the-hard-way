# 0443 - String Compression (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

## Problem Statement

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array** `chars`. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` _if there exists a triple of indices_ `(i, j, k)` _such that_ `i < j < k` _and_ `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exists, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution that runs in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity?

## Approach 1: Iterative

As stated in the problem, find the **consecutive repeating characters** frequency and once a **set of group is found** then modify the array with the character, number of occurances in the next index and repeat the process till last.

Since it's input is a char array, if number of occurrance for a character is more than 9 times, place the numbers in an invididual position and move forward.

            while (i + groupLength < chars.length && chars[i + groupLength] == chars[i]) {
                groupLength += 1;
            }
            chars[res++] = chars[i];
            if (groupLength > 1) {
                for (char c : Integer.toString(groupLength).toCharArray()) {
                    chars[res++] = c;
                }
            }
            i += groupLength;
        }
        return res;
    }
