# 0412 - Fizz Buzz (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz

## Problem Statement

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

**Constraints:**

- $$1 <= n <= 10^4$$

## Approach 1: Simulation

Just do what it says.

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0: res.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i % 3 == 0: res.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0: res.append("Buzz")
            else: res.append(str(i))
        return res
```
