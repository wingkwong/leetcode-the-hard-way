# 1903 - Largest Odd Number in String (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-odd-number-in-string/

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. Return _the **largest-valued odd** integer (as a string) that is a **non-empty substring** of_`num`_, or an empty string_`""`_if no odd integer exists_.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "52"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "4206"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "35427"
Output: "35427"
Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.
```

**Constraints:**

- $1 <= num.length <= 10 ^ 5$
- `num` only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.

## Approach 1: Retain from last odd number

A number is odd as long as the last digit is odd. Therefore, we can search the last odd digit in the string and build the substring.

                last = i
        return num[:last + 1]
