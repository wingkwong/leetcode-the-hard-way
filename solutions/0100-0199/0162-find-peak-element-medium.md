# 0162 - Find Peak Element (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

## Problem Statement

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2 ^ 31 <= nums[i] <= 2 ^ 31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

## Approach 1: Binary Search

- Initialize start as the start index of the vector (0) and end as the end index of the vector (nums.size() - 1).
- Perform binary search until start becomes equal to end.
- Calculate the middle index mid using the formula mid = start + (end - start) / 2.
- Compare nums[mid] with nums[mid + 1] to determine if the peak is on the left side or the right side of mid.
  - If nums[mid] is greater than nums[mid + 1], move the end index to mid, indicating that the peak is on the left side.
  - Otherwise, move the start index to mid + 1, indicating that the peak is on the right side.
- Repeat steps 3-4 until start becomes equal to end.
- Return the value of start, which represents the index of the peak element.

Time complexity : The time complexity of the code is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the nums vector.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the code is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.

    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Start index of the search range
        int start = 0;
        // End index of the search range
        int end = nums.size() - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            // Middle index
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // If the current element is greater than the next element,
                // move the end index to search in the left half
                end = mid;
            } else {
                // If the current element is smaller or equal to the next element,
                // move the start index to search in the right half
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
         // Return the index of the peak element
        return start;
    }
