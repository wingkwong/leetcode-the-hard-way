# 0148 - Sort List (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the list after sorting it in **ascending order**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort\_list\_1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort\_list\_2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
* `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?
