# 0101 - Symmetric Tree (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
