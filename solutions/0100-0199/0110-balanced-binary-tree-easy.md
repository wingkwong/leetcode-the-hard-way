# 0110 - Balanced Binary Tree (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of _every_ node differ in height by no more than 1.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance\_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance\_2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: true 
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
* `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

## Approach 1: Straight forward - Recursion

This solution is strictly following the definition of a balanced binary tree.  

- (1) ABS(left sub-tree's height - right sub-tree's height) <= 1.

- (2) Every left sub-trees and right sub-trees are also balanced.

First, we need to set up the base case for the recursion solution. Then we check if the whole left subtree and right subtree are balanced. If so, then we check if every subtrees are balanced.

Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$ as recursively we are going to have to process each node inside the tree at least once using a depth-first approach.

Space Complexity: $$O(h)$$ as using a recursive DFS solution will only ever hold the current path inside our call stack, which will scale with the height of the tree.

        int ld = height(root.left);
        int rd = height(root.right);
        return 1 + Math.max(ld,rd);
    }

        # Base case null node: 
        # We will use 1 as height of null node here as it accomplishes 2 things: 
        # 1. it passes up a height value for child nodes,
        #    Ex. For a child node. If we calculate the left/right height 
        #    difference, it will come out to 0 regardless if we use 0-0 or 1-1.
        # 2. it acts as a 'Truthy' value for the 'null tree'
        #    Ex. if our initial input is null, ie an empty tree. It is considered
        #    balanced, and the 1 value acts as a 'Truthy' value to return True.
