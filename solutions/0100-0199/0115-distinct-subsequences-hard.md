# 0115 - Distinct Subsequences (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`_.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.

## Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

Let $$dp[i][j]$$ be the number of distinct subsequences if $$s[0 .. i)$$contains $$t[0 .. j)$$. The base case is when $$t$$ is empty, there is one valid subsequence for each $$i$$. If the subsequence doesn't contain $$s[i - 1]$$, then we take $$dp[i - 1][j]$$. If $$s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]$$, then we need to include $$dp[i - 1][j - 1]$$ as well as $$dp[i - 1][j]$$.

            dp[i][0] = 1

        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in range(1, len(t) + 1):
                # We should have at least the same amount of matches in
                # matches in our string s[:i] as we did on s[:i - 1]
                # matching against t[:j]
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                    # Current character does match for s[:i-1] t[j-1]
                    # then we need to add all the values from the dp
                    # table of [i-1][j-1]
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1]

        return dp[len(s)][len(t)]

## Approach 2: Dynamic Programming (Space Optimised)

In Approach 1, we calculate $$dp[i][j]$$ based on the previous row. We can simplify it by using a one dimensional array of size $m$ where $$m$$ is the length of $$t$$ Then we calculate $$dp$$ backwards so that the new value won't affect the calculate of the next value.

public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.size(), m = t.size();
        unsigned long long dp[m + 1];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = min(i, m); j >= 1; j--) {
                if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]) {
                    dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m];
    }
};
```

## Approach 3: Dynamic Programming - Memoization

We can also do the problem recursively, going depth-first, and saving all the data on each iteration in case we run into it again. We can again use $$i$$ and $$j$$ to handle checking the characters of $$s[:i]$$ to $$t[:j]$$. We will have 3 main base cases in our dfs.

1. We calculated the subproblem of current $$i$$ and $$j$$ before, so we can return that cached value.
2. $$j$$ has reached $$t.length$$. Meaning we reached a subsequence that matches the target string and can return 1.
3. $$i$$ has reached $$s.length$$. Meaning we reached the end of string $$s$$ and have not yet found a subsequence that makes the target so we can return 0.

Know those 3 base cases, all we have to do is initialize our subsequence count to be the recursive call at $$i + 1$$ and $$j$$, then once we have that value, check if the characters of $$s,t$$ match at the current $$i,j$$ and if they do we can add the number of subsequences that match our recursive call at $$i + 1$$, $$j + 1$$.

Finally remember to cache the subsequence count in our cache using the key of $$(i,j)$$, and returning the subsequence value.

Time Complexity: $$O(S*T)$$ where $$S$$ is $$s.length$$ and $$T$$ is $$t.length$$. For each $$i$$ and $$j$$ up to $$s$$ and $$t$$ we make a recursive call to explore all possibilities either including or excluding the $$ith$$ character in $$s$$. By caching the answer to the subproblems, we don't have to do the repeated work.

Space Complexity: $$O(S*T)$$, as we have to store the answers to each subproblem inside our hash map cache.
