# 0103 -  Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
