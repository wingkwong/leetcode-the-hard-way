# 0104 - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
