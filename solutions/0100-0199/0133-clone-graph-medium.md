# 0133 - Clone Graph (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity\_\(graph\_theory\)#Connected\_graph) undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_copying#Deep\_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133\_clone\_graph\_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```



**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `Node.val` is unique for each node.
* There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
* The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
