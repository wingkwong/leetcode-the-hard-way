# 2146 - K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-highest-ranked-items-within-a-price-range/

## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n` that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:

- `0` represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
- `1` represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
- All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes `1` step to travel between adjacent grid cells.

You are also given integer arrays `pricing` and `start` where `pricing = [low, high]` and `start = [row, col]` indicates that you start at the position `(row, col)` and are interested only in items with a price in the range of `[low, high]` (**inclusive**). You are further given an integer `k`.

You are interested in the **positions** of the `k` **highest-ranked** items whose prices are **within** the given price range. The rank is determined by the **first** of these criteria that is different:

1. Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the `start` (**shorter** distance has a higher rank).
2. Price (**lower** price has a higher rank, but it must be **in the price range**).
3. The row number (**smaller** row number has a higher rank).
4. The column number (**smaller** column number has a higher rank).

Return _the_ `k` _highest-ranked items within the price range **sorted** by their rank (highest to lowest)_. If there are fewer than `k` reachable items within the price range, return _**all** of them_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/16/example1drawio.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1
- (1,1) with distance 2
- (2,1) with distance 3
- (2,2) with distance 4
Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/16/example2drawio1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2
Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
Explanation: You start at (2,3).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/example3.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 5
- (2,0) with distance 6
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0).
Note that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
- `pricing.length == 2`
- `2 <= low <= high <= 10^5`
- `start.length == 2`
- `0 <= row <= m - 1`
- `0 <= col <= n - 1`
- `grid[row][col] > 0`
- `1 <= k <= m * n`

## Approach 1: BFS

This is a standard BFS problem. It is not difficult to implement but we need to pay attention on the requirements.

First we put our starting point to a queue. Then iterate the current queue and check if current cell grid\[x]\[y] is within the price range. If so, we can put this cell to a temporary array for further processing. After that, we try to move in four directions. We need to check the new coordinate `(next_x, next_y)` is within boundary or not. Also we don't want to visit the same cell that we have already visited so we use `vis[next_x][next_y]` to check it. If it is not visited, we add the next cell to the queue and mark it as visited.

After we have the maximum `k` items, we need to sort them based on their rank from highest to lowest. We can apply a custom sorting comparator here. At the end, we output the coordinate of each cell. One thing to note that the reachable items can be less than `k`, hence we need to take the minimum one of `tmp.size()` and `k`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> highestRankedKItems(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<int>& pricing, vector<int>& start, int k) {
        int n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> vis(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        vector<array<int, 3>> tmp;
        queue<vector<int>> q;
        q.push(start);
        int dirx[4] = { -1, 0, 0, 1 };
        int diry[4] = { 0, 1, -1, 0 };
        vis[start[0]][start[1]] = 1;
        int step = 0;
        while (!q.empty() && tmp.size() < k) {
            step++;
            int sz = q.size();
            for (int it = 0; it < sz; it++) {
                vector<int> p = q.front(); q.pop();
                int x = p[0],  y = p[1];
                if (0 <= x && x < n && 0 <= y && y < m && grid[x][y] != 0) {
                    if (pricing[0] <= grid[x][y] && grid[x][y] <= pricing[1]) {
                        tmp.push_back({x, y, step});
                    }
                    for (int d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                        int next_x = x + dirx[d];
                        int next_y = y + diry[d];
                        if (0 <= next_x && next_x < n && 0 <= next_y && next_y < m && !vis[next_x][next_y]) {
                            vis[next_x][next_y] = 1;
                            q.push({next_x, next_y});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        sort(tmp.begin(), tmp.end(), [&](const array<int, 3>& x, const array<int, 3>& y) {
            return (x[2] < y[2]) ||
                   (x[2] == y[2] && grid[x[0]][x[1]] < grid[y[0]][y[1]]) ||
                   (x[2] == y[2] && grid[x[0]][x[1]] ==  grid[y[0]][y[1]] && x[0] < y[0]) ||
                   (x[2] == y[2] && grid[x[0]][x[1]] ==  grid[y[0]][y[1]] && x[0] == y[0] && x[1] < y[1]);
        });
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < min((int) tmp.size(), k); i++) {
            ans.push_back({tmp[i][0], tmp[i][1]});
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

In fact, a custom comparator is not necessary if we push the criteria in the same order to `tmp`, i.e. distance, price, row number and column number. This is because the `sort()` will sort them based on this order.
