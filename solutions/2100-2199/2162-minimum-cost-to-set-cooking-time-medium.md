# 2162 - Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-set-cooking-time/

## Problem Statement

A generic microwave supports cooking times for:

- at least `1` second.
- at most `99` minutes and `99` seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push **at most four digits**. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by **prepending zeroes**. It interprets the **first** two digits as the minutes and the **last** two digits as the seconds. It then **adds** them up as the cooking time. For example,

- You push `9` `5` `4` (three digits). It is normalized as `0954` and interpreted as `9` minutes and `54` seconds.
- You push `0` `0` `0` `8` (four digits). It is interpreted as `0` minutes and `8` seconds.
- You push `8` `0` `9` `0`. It is interpreted as `80` minutes and `90` seconds.
- You push `8` `1` `3` `0`. It is interpreted as `81` minutes and `30` seconds.

You are given integers `startAt`, `moveCost`, `pushCost`, and `targetSeconds`. **Initially**, your finger is on the digit `startAt`. Moving the finger above **any specific digit** costs `moveCost` units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger **once** costs `pushCost` units of fatigue.

There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for `targetSeconds` seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.

Return _the **minimum cost** to set_ `targetSeconds` _seconds of cooking time_.

Remember that one minute consists of `60` seconds.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/2.png)

```
Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6
Note other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them produces the minimum cost.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= startAt <= 9`
- `1 <= moveCost, pushCost <= 1e5`
- `1 <= targetSeconds <= 6039`

## Approach 1: Simulation

We just need to simulate two cases at most. We either take the original $$m$$and $$s$$, or we can try $$m' := m -1$$ and $$s' := s + 60$$.

First let's get the minutes $$m$$ and seconds $$s$$ from $$targetSeconds$$. If they are valid, then we can calculate the cost for the first case.

To calculate the cost, it is pretty straightforward. Example 2 gives a good hint to remind us to handle leading zeros.

After calculating the first possible minimum cost, we can try the second one. Similarly, we check if $$m'$$ and $$s'$$ are valid. If so, calculate the cost and return the minimum one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calc(vector<int>& d, int startAt, int moveCost, int pushCost) {
        int res = 0, prev = startAt, f = 1;
        for (auto now : d) {
            if (now == 0 && f) continue;
            if (f) f ^= 1;
            if (now != prev) res += moveCost, prev = now;
            res += pushCost;
        }
        return res;
    }

    int minCostSetTime(int startAt, int moveCost, int pushCost, int targetSeconds) {
        int ans = 1e9, m = targetSeconds / 60, s = targetSeconds % 60;
        vector<int> d(4);
        if (min(m, s) >= 0 && max(m, s) <= 99) {
            d = { m / 10, m % 10, s / 10, s % 10 };
            ans = min(ans, calc(d, startAt, moveCost, pushCost));
        }
        m -= 1, s += 60;
        if (min(m, s) >= 0 && max(m, s) <= 99) {
            d = { m / 10, m % 10, s / 10, s % 10 };
            ans = min(ans, calc(d, startAt, moveCost, pushCost));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
