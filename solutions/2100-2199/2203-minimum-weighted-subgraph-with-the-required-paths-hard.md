# 2203 - Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-weighted-subgraph-with-the-required-paths/

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from `fromi` to `toi` with weight `weighti`.

Lastly, you are given three **distinct** integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return _the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach_ `dest` _from both_ `src1` _and_ `src2` _via a set of edges of this subgraph_. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
Output: 9
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example2-1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`
- `fromi != toi`
- `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.
- `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5`

## Approach 1: Dijkstra x 3

We calculate the shortest paths for each node from $$src1$$, $$src2$$ and $$dest$$. For $$dest$$, we need to do it in a reversed order. If we cannot reach $$src1$$ or $$src2$$ from $$dest$$, then the answer is $$-1$$. Otherwise, we iterate each node to find the distances and sum them together to take the minimal one.
