# 2201 - Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-artifacts-that-can-be-extracted/

## Problem Statement

There is an `n x n` **0-indexed** grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `artifacts` describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where `artifacts[i] = [r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i]` denotes that the `ith` artifact is buried in the subgrid where:

- `(r1i, c1i)` is the coordinate of the **top-left** cell of the `ith` artifact and
- `(r2i, c2i)` is the coordinate of the **bottom-right** cell of the `ith` artifact.

You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `dig` where `dig[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that you will excavate the cell `(ri, ci)`, return _the number of artifacts that you can extract_.

The test cases are generated such that:

- No two artifacts overlap.
- Each artifact only covers at most `4` cells.
- The entries of `dig` are unique.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram.jpg)

```
Input: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid.
There is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact.
The blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it.
Thus, we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram-1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both the red and blue artifacts have all parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted, so we return 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= artifacts.length, dig.length <= min(n2, 10^5)`
- `artifacts[i].length == 4`
- `dig[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i, ri, ci <= n - 1`
- `r1i <= r2i`
- `c1i <= c2i`
- No two artifacts will overlap.
- The number of cells covered by an artifact is **at most** `4`.
- The entries of `dig` are unique.

## Approach 1: Loops

Check if each cell from $$(r1_i, c1_i)$$ to $$(r2_i, c2_i)$$ in $$artifacts[i]$$ are all dug or not. If so, increase $$ans$$ by $$1$$.

        int ans = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> isDug(n, vector<int>(n));
        for (auto x : dig) isDug[x[0]][x[1]] = 1;
        for (auto x : art) {
            int ok = 1;
            for (int i = x[0]; i <= x[2] && ok; i++) {
                for (int j = x[1]; j <= x[3] && ok; j++) {
                    if (!isDug[i][j]) {
                        ok = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
            ans += ok;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
