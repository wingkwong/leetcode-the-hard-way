# 2195 - Append K Integers With Minimal Sum (Medium)

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Append `k` **unique positive** integers that do **not** appear in `nums` to `nums` such that the resulting total sum is **minimum**.

Return _the sum of the_ `k` _integers appended to_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,4,25,10,25], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.
The resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.
The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,6], k = 6
Output: 25
Explanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum. 
The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9`
