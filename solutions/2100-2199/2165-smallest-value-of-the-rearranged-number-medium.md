# 2165 - Smallest Value of the Rearranged Number (Medium)

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `num.` **Rearrange** the digits of `num` such that its value is **minimized** and it does not contain **any** leading zeros.

Return _the rearranged number with minimal value_.

Note that the sign of the number does not change after rearranging the digits.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 310
Output: 103
Explanation: The possible arrangements for the digits of 310 are 013, 031, 103, 130, 301, 310. 
The arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is 103.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = -7605
Output: -7650
Explanation: Some possible arrangements for the digits of -7605 are -7650, -6705, -5076, -0567.
The arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is -7650.
```

**Constraints:**

* `-10^15 <= num <= 10^15`
