# 2122 - Recover the Original Array (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-the-original-array/

## Problem Statement

Alice had a **0-indexed** array `arr` consisting of `n` **positive** integers. She chose an arbitrary **positive integer** `k` and created two new **0-indexed** integer arrays `lower` and `higher` in the following manner:

1. `lower[i] = arr[i] - k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`
2. `higher[i] = arr[i] + k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays `lower` and `higher`, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array `nums` consisting of `2n` integers, where **exactly** `n` of the integers were present in `lower` and the remaining in `higher`, return _the **original** array_ `arr`. In case the answer is not unique, return _**any** valid array_.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that there exists **at least one** valid array `arr`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 * n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- The test cases are generated such that there exists **at least one** valid array `arr`.

## Approach 1: Try all possible k

In short, we just need to try all possible $$k$$. If we sort $$nums$$, the smallest element must be in the lower array. It is easy to see $$k$$k can be $$(nums[i]âˆ’nums[0])/2$$. We try each $$k$$ to see if we can match all the pairs. If the size of lower array is same as that of higher array, then the answer would be $$ans[j]=(l[j]+r[j])/2$$.

                    m[nums[j]]++;

            }

                for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
