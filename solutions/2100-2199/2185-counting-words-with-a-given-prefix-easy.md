# 2185 - Counting Words With a Given Prefix (Easy)

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return _the number of strings in_ `words` _that contain_ `pref` _as a **prefix**_.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
* `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.
