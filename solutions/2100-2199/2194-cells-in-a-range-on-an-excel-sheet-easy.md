# 2194 - Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-in-a-range-on-an-excel-sheet/

## Problem Statement

A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string `"<col><row>"` where:

- `<col>` denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by **alphabetical letters**.
  - For example, the `1st` column is denoted by `'A'`, the `2nd` by `'B'`, the `3rd` by `'C'`, and so on.
- `<row>` is the row number `r` of the cell. The `rth` row is represented by the **integer** `r`.

You are given a string `s` in the format `"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>"`, where `<col1>` represents the column `c1`, `<row1>` represents the row `r1`, `<col2>` represents the column `c2`, and `<row2>` represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and `c1 <= c2`.

Return _the **list of cells**_ `(x, y)` _such that_ `r1 <= x <= r2` _and_ `c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as **strings** in the format mentioned above and be sorted in **non-decreasing** order first by columns and then by rows.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/08/ex1drawio.png)

```
Input: s = "K1:L2"
Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/09/exam2drawio.png)

```
Input: s = "A1:F1"
Output: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.
```

**Constraints:**

- `s.length == 5`
- `'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'`
- `'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'`
- `s` consists of uppercase English letters, digits and `':'`.

## Approach 1: Loops

Iterate each letter from $$s[0]$$ to $$s[3]$$ and iterate each number from $$s[1]$$ to $$s[4]$$ to build the answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> cellsInRange(string s) {
        vector<string> ans;
        // iterate each letter
        for (char x = s[0]; x <= s[3]; x++) {
            // iterate each number
            for (int y = s[1] - '0'; y <= s[4] - '0'; y++) {
                // build the answer
                ans.push_back(x + to_string(y));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
