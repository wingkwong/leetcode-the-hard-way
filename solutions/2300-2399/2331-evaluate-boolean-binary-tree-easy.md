# 2331 - Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:

- **Leaf nodes** have either the value `0` or `1`, where `0` represents `False` and `1` represents `True`.
- **Non-leaf nodes** have either the value `2` or `3`, where `2` represents the boolean `OR` and `3` represents the boolean `AND`.

The **evaluation** of a node is as follows:

- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `True` or `False`.
- Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's two children and **apply** the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return _the boolean result of **evaluating** the_ `root` _node._

A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has either `0` or `2` children.

A **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/16/example1drawio1.png)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 3`
- Every node has either `0` or `2` children.
- Leaf nodes have a value of `0` or `1`.
- Non-leaf nodes have a value of `2` or `3`.

## Approach 1: Recursive

We have four cases:

1. If the value is 0, then return false
2. If the value is 1, then return true
3. If the value is 2, then call the function on left tree and right tree and apply OR operation on both returned values
4. If the value is 3, then call the function on left tree and right tree and apply AND operation on both returned values

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // case 1
        if (root->val == 0) return false;
        // case 2
        else if (root->val == 1) return true;
        // case 3
        else if (root->val == 2) return evaluateTree(root->left) || evaluateTree(root->right);
        // case 4
        return evaluateTree(root->left) && evaluateTree(root->right);
    }
};
```
