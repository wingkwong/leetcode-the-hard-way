# 2357 - Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-zero-by-subtracting-equal-amounts

## Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

- Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the **smallest non-zero** element in `nums`.
- Subtract `x` from every **positive** element in `nums`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make every element in_ `nums` _equal to_ `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Approach: Counting

Observations:

- We can remove all numbers `x` in one go
- We need $n$ moves to remove $n$ distinct numbers
- Hence, the problem is to find out the number of different positive numbers

```go
func minimumOperations(nums []int) int {
    s := make(map[int]bool)
    for _, v := range nums {
        if v > 0 {
            s[v] = true
        }
    }
    return len(s)
}
```
