## Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

* Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the **smallest non-zero** element in `nums`.
* Subtract `x` from every **positive** element in `nums`.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make every element in_ `nums` _equal to_ `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
