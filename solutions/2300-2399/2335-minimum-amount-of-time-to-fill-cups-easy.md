## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups

## Problem Statement

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up `2` cups with **different** types of water, or `1` cup of any type of water.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `amount` of length `3` where `amount[0]`, `amount[1]`, and `amount[2]` denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return _the **minimum** number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups_.&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = [1,4,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = [5,4,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.
Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = [5,0,0]
Output: 5
Explanation: Every second, we fill up a cold cup.
```

**Constraints:**

- `amount.length == 3`
- `0 <= amount[i] <= 100`
