# 2274 - Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-consecutive-floors-without-special-floors

## Problem Statement

Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors**, used for relaxation only.

You are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from `bottom` to `top` (**inclusive**). You are also given the integer array `special`, where `special[i]` denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.

Return _the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the ranges (inclusive) of consecutive floors without a special floor:
- (2, 3) with a total amount of 2 floors.
- (5, 5) with a total amount of 1 floor.
- (7, 9) with a total amount of 3 floors.
Therefore, we return the maximum number which is 3 floors.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bottom = 6, top = 8, special = [7,6,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: Every floor rented is a special floor, so we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= special.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= bottom <= special[i] <= top <= 10^9`
- All the values of `special` are **unique**.

## Approach 1: Sorting

We add $bottom - 1$ and $top + 1$ to the array $special$ and sort the array so that we can easily calculate consecutive floors between two special floors.

The answer would be the maximum result of $special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1$ for $i = [1 .. n)$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, vector<int>& special) {
        int ans = 0;
        special.push_back(bottom - 1);
        special.push_back(top + 1);
        sort(special.begin(), special.end());
        for (int i = 1; i < special.size(); i++) {
            ans = max(ans, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
