# 2217 - Find Palindrome With Fixed Length (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-palindrome-with-fixed-length/

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `queries` and a **positive** integer `intLength`, return _an array_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is either the_ `queries[i]th` _smallest **positive palindrome** of length_ `intLength` _or_ `-1` _if no such palindrome exists_.

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: queries = [1,2,3,4,5,90], intLength = 3
Output: [101,111,121,131,141,999]
Explanation:
The first few palindromes of length 3 are:
101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 201, ...
The 90th palindrome of length 3 is 999.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: queries = [2,4,6], intLength = 4
Output: [1111,1331,1551]
Explanation:
The first six palindromes of length 4 are:
1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, and 1551.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= queries[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= intLength <= 15`
