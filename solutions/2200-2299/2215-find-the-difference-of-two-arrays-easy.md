# 2215 - Find the Difference of Two Arrays (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays/

## Problem Statement

Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _a list_ `answer` _of size_ `2` _where:_

- `answer[0]` _is a list of all **distinct** integers in_ `nums1` _which are **not** present in_ `nums2`_._
- `answer[1]` _is a list of all **distinct** integers in_ `nums2` _which are **not** present in_ `nums1`.

**Note** that the integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].
Every integer in nums2 is present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
