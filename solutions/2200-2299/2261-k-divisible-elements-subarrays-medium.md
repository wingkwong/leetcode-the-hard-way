# 2261 - K Divisible Elements Subarrays (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-divisible-elements-subarrays/

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`, return _the number of **distinct subarrays** which have **at most**_ `k` _elements divisible by_ `p`.

Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are said to be **distinct** if:

- They are of **different** lengths, or
- There exists **at least** one index `i` where `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

A **subarray** is defined as a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2], k = 2, p = 2
Output: 11
Explanation:
The elements at indices 0, 3, and 4 are divisible by p = 2.
The 11 distinct subarrays which have at most k = 2 elements divisible by 2 are:
[2], [2,3], [2,3,3], [2,3,3,2], [3], [3,3], [3,3,2], [3,3,2,2], [3,2], [3,2,2], and [2,2].
Note that the subarrays [2] and [3] occur more than once in nums, but they should each be counted only once.
The subarray [2,3,3,2,2] should not be counted because it has 3 elements that are divisible by 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 4, p = 1
Output: 10
Explanation:
All element of nums are divisible by p = 1.
Also, every subarray of nums will have at most 4 elements that are divisible by 1.
Since all subarrays are distinct, the total number of subarrays satisfying all the constraints is 10.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i], p <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Approach 1: Brute Force

Build all subarrays and insert them to set. The answer would be the size of the set.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k, int p) {
        int ans = 0, n = nums.size();
        set<string> s;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int cnt = 0;
            string t;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                // below line will cause TLE
                // cnt += nums[j] % p == 0;
                // use below instead
                cnt += nums[j] % p == 0 ? 1 : 0;
                // or
                // if (nums[j] % p == 0) cnt += 1;
                if (cnt <= k) {
                    t = t + to_string(nums[j]) + "|";
                    s.insert(t);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return (int) s.size();
    }
};
```
