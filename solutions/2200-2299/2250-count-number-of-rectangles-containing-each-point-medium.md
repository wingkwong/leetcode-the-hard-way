# 2250 - Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-rectangles-containing-each-point/

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, hi]` indicates that `ith` rectangle has a length of `li` and a height of `hi`. You are also given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[j] = [xj, yj]` is a point with coordinates `(xj, yj)`.

The `ith` rectangle has its **bottom-left corner** point at the coordinates `(0, 0)` and its **top-right corner** point at `(li, hi)`.

Return _an integer array_ `count` _of length_ `points.length` _where_ `count[j]` _is the number of rectangles that **contain** the_ `jth` _point._

The `ith` rectangle **contains** the `jth` point if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= hi`. Note that points that lie on the **edges** of a rectangle are also considered to be contained by that rectangle.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/example1.png)

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,5]], points = [[2,1],[1,4]]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation:
The first rectangle contains no points.
The second rectangle contains only the point (2, 1).
The third rectangle contains the points (2, 1) and (1, 4).
The number of rectangles that contain the point (2, 1) is 2.
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 4) is 1.
Therefore, we return [2, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/example2.png)

```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], points = [[1,3],[1,1]]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation:
The first rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
The second rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
The third rectangle contains the points (1, 3) and (1, 1).
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 3) is 1.
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 1) is 3.
Therefore, we return [1, 3].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length, points.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `rectangles[i].length == points[j].length == 2`
- `1 <= li, xj <= 10^9`
- `1 <= hi, yj <= 100`
- All the `rectangles` are **unique**.
- All the `points` are **unique**.

## Approach 1: Lower Bound

Observation: The max $$y$$ is only $$100$$, while the max $$x$$is $$10^9$$.

For each $$y$$, we push the corresponding $$x$$ and then we sort all the $$x$$s for each $$y$$.

Then iterate each point, and iterate from $$p_y$$ to $$max_y$$to check how many points are greater than $$p_x$$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int mxY = 101;
        vector<int> ans;
        vector<vector<int>> m(mxY);
        // use y as a key
        for (auto& r : rectangles) m[r[1]].push_back(r[0]);
        // sort m[i]
        for (int i = 0; i < mxY; i++) sort(m[i].begin(), m[i].end());
        // iterate each point
        for (auto& p : points) {
            int cnt = 0;
            // iterate from p[1] to mxY
            // as these points are covering p[1]
            for (int y = p[1]; y < mxY; y++) {
                // find the first position that p[0] can fit into
                // elements behind this position can form rectangles
                // covering (p[0], p[1])
                cnt += m[y].end() - lower_bound(m[y].begin(), m[y].end(), p[0]);
            }
            // push the result to ans
            ans.push_back(cnt);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
