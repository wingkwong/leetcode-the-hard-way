# 2262 - Total Appeal of A String (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/total-appeal-of-a-string/

## Problem Statement

The **appeal** of a string is the number of **distinct** characters found in the string.

- For example, the appeal of `"abbca"` is `3` because it has `3` distinct characters: `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

Given a string `s`, return _the **total appeal of all of its substrings.**_

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbca"
Output: 28
Explanation: The following are the substrings of "abbca":
- Substrings of length 1: "a", "b", "b", "c", "a" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.
- Substrings of length 2: "ab", "bb", "bc", "ca" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 3: "abb", "bbc", "bca" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 4: "abbc", "bbca" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 5: "abbca" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.
The total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "code"
Output: 20
Explanation: The following are the substrings of "code":
- Substrings of length 1: "c", "o", "d", "e" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.
- Substrings of length 2: "co", "od", "de" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 3: "cod", "ode" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 4: "code" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.
The total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Approach 1: Hash Map

Observation: The appeal of all substrings ending at $$i$$-th is that ending at $$i - 1$$th plus the number of substrings that don't contain $$s[i]$$, which can be calculated by tracking the last occurrence.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long appealSum(string s) {
        long long ans = 0, cnt = 1, n = s.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> last;
        last[s[0]] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cnt += i - last[s[i]] + 1;
            last[s[i]] = i + 1;
            ans += cnt;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
