# 2216 - Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-array-beautiful/

## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. The array `nums` is **beautiful** if:

- `nums.length` is even.
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all `i % 2 == 0`.

Note that an empty array is considered beautiful.

You can delete any number of elements from `nums`. When you delete an element, all the elements to the right of the deleted element will be **shifted one unit to the left** to fill the gap created and all the elements to the left of the deleted element will remain **unchanged**.

Return _the **minimum** number of elements to delete from_ `nums` _to make it beautiful._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can delete either nums[0] or nums[1] to make nums = [1,2,3,5] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 1 deletion to make nums beautiful.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete nums[0] and nums[5] to make nums = [1,2,2,3] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 2 deletions to make nums beautiful.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
