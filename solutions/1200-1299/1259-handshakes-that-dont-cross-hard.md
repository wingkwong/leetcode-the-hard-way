# 1259 - Handshakes That Don't Cross (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/handshakes-that-dont-cross/

## Problem Statement

You are given an **even** number of people `numPeople` that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are `numPeople / 2` handshakes total.

Return _the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross_.

Since the answer could be very large, return it **modulo** `1e9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numPeople = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/11/5125_example_3.png)

```
Input: numPeople = 6
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numPeople <= 1000`
- `numPeople` is even.

## Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

Person 1 can shake hand with person with even number but not with odd number because every time we need to divide the group into two sets. For example, if person 1 shakes hand with person 2, then there is an empty set and a set of people with numbers from 3 to n. If person 1 shakes hand with person 4, then the first set is person 2 + person 3 and the second set is from 5 to n. At the end, we would have a set from person 2 to n - 1 and an empty set.

In general, let $$dp[i]$$ be the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross of for $$i$$ people. If person $$i$$ shakes hand with person $$j$$, then we could divide into two sets - one from 2 to j - 1 and another one from j - 1 to i. The product of them would be the contribution to $$dp[i]$$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(int n) {
        int M = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 2; j <= i; j += 2) {
                // two sets :
                // 1. [2 .. j - 1] = j - 1 - 2 + 1 = j - 2
                // 2. [j + 1 .. i] = i - (j + 1) + 1 = i - j
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + (dp[j - 2] * dp[i - j])) % M;
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
