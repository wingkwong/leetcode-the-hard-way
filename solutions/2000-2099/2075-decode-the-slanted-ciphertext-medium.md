# 2075 - Decode the Slanted Ciphertext (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-slanted-ciphertext

## Problem Statement

A string `originalText` is encoded using a **slanted transposition cipher** to a string `encodedText` with the help of a matrix having a **fixed number of rows** `rows`.

`originalText` is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.

The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of `originalText`. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with `' '`. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will **not be empty** after filling in `originalText`.

`encodedText` is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.

The characters in the blue cells are appended first to `encodedText`, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.

For example, if `originalText = "cipher"` and `rows = 3`, then we encode it in the following manner:

The blue arrows depict how `originalText` is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which `encodedText` is formed. In the above example, `encodedText = "ch ie pr"`.

Given the encoded string `encodedText` and number of rows `rows`, return _the original string_ `originalText`.

**Note:** `originalText` **does not** have any trailing spaces `' '`. The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible `originalText`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: encodedText = "ch   ie   pr", rows = 3
Output: "cipher"
Explanation: This is the same example described in the problem description.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/26/exam1.png)

```
Input: encodedText = "iveo    eed   l te   olc", rows = 4
Output: "i love leetcode"
Explanation: The figure above denotes the matrix that was used to encode originalText.
The blue arrows show how we can find originalText from encodedText.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/26/eg2.png)

```
Input: encodedText = "coding", rows = 1
Output: "coding"
Explanation: Since there is only 1 row, both originalText and encodedText are the same.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= encodedText.length <= 10^6`
- `encodedText` consists of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
- `encodedText` is a valid encoding of some `originalText` that **does not** have trailing spaces.
- `1 <= rows <= 1000`
- The testcases are generated such that there is **only one** possible `originalText`.

## Approach 1: Simulation

<SolutionAuthor name="@wkw"/>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string decodeCiphertext(string encodedText, int rows) {
        string ans;
        int n = encodedText.size(), col = n / rows;
        // iterate each col
        for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
            // starting from the first character,
            // we traverse encodedText diagonally
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += col + 1) {
                ans += encodedText[j];
            }
        }
        // remove all the spaces at the end
        while (ans.back() == ' ') ans.pop_back();
        return ans;
    }
};
```
