# 2013 - Detect Squares (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/

## Problem Statement

You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:

- **Adds** new points from the stream into a data structure. **Duplicate** points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
- Given a query point, **counts** the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an **axis-aligned square** with **positive area**. An **axis-aligned square** is a square whose edges are all the same length and are either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis.

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:

- `DetectSquares()` Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- `void add(int[] point)` Adds a new point `point = [x, y]` to the data structure.
- `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of ways to form **axis-aligned squares** with point `point = [x, y]` as described above.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["DetectSquares", "add", "add", "add", "count", "count", "add", "count"]
[[], [[3, 10]], [[11, 2]], [[3, 2]], [[11, 10]], [[14, 8]], [[11, 2]], [[11, 10]]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 1, 0, null, 2]

Explanation
DetectSquares detectSquares = new DetectSquares();
detectSquares.add([3, 10]);
detectSquares.add([11, 2]);
detectSquares.add([3, 2]);
detectSquares.count([11, 10]); // return 1. You can choose:
                               //   - The first, second, and third points
detectSquares.count([14, 8]);  // return 0. The query point cannot form a square with any points in the data structure.
detectSquares.add([11, 2]);    // Adding duplicate points is allowed.
detectSquares.count([11, 10]); // return 2. You can choose:
                               //   - The first, second, and third points
                               //   - The first, third, and fourth points
```

**Constraints:**

- `point.length == 2`
- `0 <= x, y <= 1000`
- At most `3000` calls in total will be made to `add` and `count`.

## Approach 1: Checking for Diagonal Points

This a tricky problem that can be greatly simplified by knowing what to do. If for any given count call, we can check all points inside our hash map and only continue with our algorithm if the point is directly diagonal with the point we are given, then we know we can only create a square with those two points, if there are 2 points that are adjacent to those points, to create the other 2 corners.

Meaning during our search for diagonal points, we want a difference in $$x,y$$ that is a $$dx, dy$$ where $$dx != dy$$ and the $$x$$ and $$y$$ values of our potential diagonal points aren't equal, otherwise, that means they are on the same axis.

When we find a suitable corner, we can check the adjacent positions where a corner would need to exist to create a square and multiply the number of points of all three corners to add to our total result. Obviously, if any of those corners don't exist, we will multiply by $$0$$, not creating a square.

Time Complexity:

- Add: $$O(1)$$, we can add points to our data structure in constant time.
- Count: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of unique points. We are going to check through all unique points once, doing constant time work to determine if we can create a square, and increment our count for the number of squares we find.

Space Complexity: $$O(n)$$ where $$n$$ is the number of unique points. We are going to maintain a hash map for our data structure, only creating keys for unique points, and incrementing a value for those points if we find duplicates.
