# 0073 - Set Matrix Zeroes (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`'s.

You must do it [in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[0].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:**

- A straightforward solution using `O(mn)` space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses `O(m + n)` space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Approach 1: Inplace, Constant Space, Iteration.

To save space, we can just iterate over the entire matrix initially, if we ever reach a $$0$$, we can record that in the top row/left column, by rewriting it with a $$0$$. Then we can check the top row, left column at the end, and rewrite all rows/columns that have a top row/left column as $$0$$.

The edge case you can imagine is how we handle the top left corner. If we have a $$0$$ in the first row/first column and place a $$0$$ in the first row/column, then when we replace all numbers afterwards, we are going to ruin our tracking method.

To handle this, we can use a boolean to track if the first row/first column has zeroes, iterate the first/row column, and update the boolean of the first row/column has a $$0$$. From then on, we can do as we described above, just starting at $$1$$ for both the row/column, as we already handled the first row/column.

Finally, we can rewrite everything, again starting at $$1$$ for both the row/column, and handling the first row/column at the end, based on the boolean values we found earlier.

Time Complexity: $$O(m * n)$$. Where $$m$$ is the number of rows, and $$n$$ is the number of columns. We must iterate over the whole matrix a couple of times.

Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$. We can do it in constant extra space, by using the first row/column to track which rows and columns are zeroed out and using boolean values to handle the first row/column.
