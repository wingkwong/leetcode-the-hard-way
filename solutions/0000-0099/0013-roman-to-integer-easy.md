# 0013 - Roman to Integer (Easy)

## Problem Link

<https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/>

## Problem Statement

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```Python
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

```Python
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```Python
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```Python
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Approach 1: Iterating over the string

The solution used was iterating over the string and executing a condition that meets the subtraction principles described above in the problem statement, in order to return the result corresponding to the final sum.

The condition says: if the current character is greater than the previous character then subtract the previous character value from the $result$, otherwise increment the value of the previous character to the $result$.

For example, if we consider the string $s = 'XIV'$, the first character `'X'` whose value is `10` will satisfy the condition, since the $previousChar$ variable is initialized with `0`, then $result$ still remains `0`.
The second character `'I'` whose value is `1` won't satisfy the condition once `1` isn't greater than $previousChar$ which is now `10`. So $result$ is incremented by `10` and $previousChar$ is updated to `1`.
Finally, the third character `'V'` whose value is `5` will satisfy the condition because is greater than $previousChar$. So from the $result$ is subtracted `1` and $previousChar$ is updated to 5.
The code finishes the loop with $result = 9$ and finally increments the value of $previousChar$ to the $result$. So our final $result$ becomes `14`.

**Time Complexity: $O(n)$**

This solution will be $O(n)$ as the time varies proportionally to the length of the string.

**Space Complexity: $O(1)$**

The space complexity for this solution is $O(1)$ as we only created variables for the counters and they're not related to the input size.
