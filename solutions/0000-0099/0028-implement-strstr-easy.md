# 0028 - Implement strStr() \[Easy]

## Problem Statement

Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf\(java.lang.String\)).
