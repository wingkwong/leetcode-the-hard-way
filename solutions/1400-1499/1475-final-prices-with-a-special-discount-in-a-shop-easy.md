# 1475 - Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop (Easy)

## Problem Statement

Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `ith` item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the `ith` item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the **minimum** index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

_Return an array where the `ith` element is the final price you will pay for the `ith` item of the shop considering the special discount._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 500`
* `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^3`
