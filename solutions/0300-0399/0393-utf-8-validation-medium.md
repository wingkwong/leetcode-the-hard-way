# 0393 - UTF-8 Validation (Medium)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `data` representing the data, return whether it is a valid **UTF-8** encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in **UTF8** can be from **1 to 4 bytes** long, subjected to the following rules:

1. For a **1-byte** character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.
2. For an **n-bytes** character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the `n + 1` bit is `0`, followed by `n - 1` bytes with the most significant `2` bits being `10`.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

```
Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

`x` denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either `0` or `1`.

**Note:**The input is an array of integers. Only the **least significant 8 bits** of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= data.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= data[i] <= 255`

// Time Complexity : O(N) where N is the number of elements in data
// Space Complexity: O(1)

    // the idea is to keep track the number of segments of utf-8 octet sequence left
    // we increase / decrease the count based on some cases
    // first you need to know that `x >> n` means shift the number `x` `n` bits to the right
    // e.g. shift 110xxxxx 5 bits to the right becomes 110 (in binary format)
    // e.g. shift 11110xxx 4 bits to the right becomes 1111 (in binary format)
    // second, 0bxxxx is a binary literal which means xxxx is a binary number
    // alternatively, you can use decimal format but it's not that convenient in this problem
    // e.g. 0b1110 -> 14
