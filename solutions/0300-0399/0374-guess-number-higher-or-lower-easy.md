# 0374 - Guess Number Higher or Lower (Easy)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/

## Problem Statement

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`

## Approach 1: Binary Search

See [Binary Search](../../tutorials/basic-topics/binary-search) for basic understanding.
