# 0329 - Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix (Hard)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` integers `matrix`, return _the length of the longest increasing path in_ `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You **may not** move **diagonally** or move **outside the boundary** (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/05/grid1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/27/tmp-grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach 1: Dynamic Programming - Memoization

We can very easily run a DFS on each cell, calculating the path length for each traversal, and tracking a global longest path. Obviously, we would end up doing a lot of the same work though, so we can store it in a hash map, to reuse the work for later.

Our DFS function will need to track current position in the matrix, as well as the value of the cell we are coming from, and our cache will need to store the length of the path to traverse to cell $$(r,c)$$ where $$r$$ is the row index, and $$c$$ is the column index.

Time Complexity: $$O(m*n)$$, where $$m$$ is $$matrix.length$$ and $$n$$ in $$matrix[i].length$$. We are going to have to traverse each cell in the matrix, but we only have to do so once as we can reuse work from previous traversals of each cell.

Space Complexity: $$O(m*n)$$. Our hash map storing our reused work will take up to $$m*n$$ space as we may store up to $$m*n$$ key, value pairs inside.

        DIRS = ((1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1))

        self.longest_path = 1
        # cache: key -> (row, col) value: integer, path length to cell.

                    # call return value + 1.
                    path = max(path, 1 + dfs(new_r, new_c, matrix[r][c]))

            for c in range(COLS):
                # call DFS on each cell. Initialize prev_cell value of
                # inf as all other values will be below that.
                dfs(r, c, float('inf'))
        return self.longest_path
```

## Approach 2: Topological Sort

We can create a directed graph, track the dependencies for each node in the graph, traverse it, and find the length of the longest path.

We would do this by tracking an adjacency list, which would be a hash map that maps each $$(row, column)$$ coordinate to any other cells (row, column) coordinate which is greater than it. Thus creating a directed graph which will only point to increasing values.

We must also track dependencies for each cell so that we can only start at the start points of these paths. We can put these cells with an $$indegrees$$ of $$0$$ into a queue, then use that queue to traverse all the paths, updating the queue any time the $$indegrees$$ of another cell reaches $$0$$.

Time Complexity: $$O(m*n)$$ where $$m$$ is $$matrix.length$$ and $$n$$ in $$matrix[i].length$$. We are going to visit each cell once during the topological sort and check each neighbour.

Space Complexity: $$O(m*n)$$ as well, to track our $$indegrees$$ array and our $$queue$$, as well as our $$adjacency list$$.
