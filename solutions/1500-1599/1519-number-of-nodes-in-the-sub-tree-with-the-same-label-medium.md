# 1519 - Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-nodes-in-the-sub-tree-with-the-same-label/

## Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return _an array of size n_ where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"
Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = "bbbb"
Output: [4,2,1,1]
Explanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.
The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = "aabab"
Output: [3,2,1,1,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `labels.length == n`
- `labels` is consisting of only of lowercase English letters.

            g[x[1]].push_back(x[0]);

            // traverse the children of u

                // if v is not same as p
                if (p ^ v) {
                    // get the count of labels in subtree
                    vector<int> cnt2 = dfs(v, u);
                    // add it back to cnt
                    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) cnt[i] += cnt2[i];
                }
            }
            // set the answer
            ans[u] = cnt[labels[u] - 'a'];
            return cnt;
        };
        dfs(0, -1);
        return ans;
    }
};
