## Before Creating a PR 

- Make sure you've read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wingkwong/leetcode-the-hard-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
- Make sure you've followed the template format
- Make sure you've started the app locally and verified the content and links (if applicable)
- Make sure you've applied LaTex for variables or formulas
- Make sure you've formatted your code well (using `<Tabs/>`)
- Make sure you've explained your code well (write comments above each line)
- Make sure you've written your explanation well and it is easy to understand for beginners
- Make sure you've explained your topic using 1 - 3 LC problems (for tutorial writeup)
- Make sure you've provided suggested problems at the end (for tutorial writeup)
- Make sure you've given credits / references if you use external resources

## Tutorials

- Go to `./tutorials`
- Use the below template
- Use LC problems to walk through the topic
- Don't copy content / code from other sites
- Add references if necessary
- Add Suggested Problems at the end

```bash

<TutorialAuthors names="@<YOUR_ALIAS>"/>

## Overview

// Your content goes here

// Walk through the topic using 1 - 3 LC problems (if applicable)
// Do not use random examples or examples from other sites

// Suggested Problems
// See the examples below to learn how to render
```

Examples: 

- [binary-exponentiation.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingkwong/leetcode-the-hard-way/main/tutorials/math/number-theory/binary-exponentiation.md)

- [prefix-sum.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingkwong/leetcode-the-hard-way/main/tutorials/basic-topics/prefix-sum.md)


## Solutions

- Go to `./solutions`
- Create a new page called `<PROBLEM_ID>-<PROBLEM_TITLE>-<DIFFICULTY>.md`, e.g. `0202-happy-number-easy.md`
- Include basic meta info such as `description` and `tags`. 
- Use `<Tabs>` to wrap your code block. See below example.
- Add Time Complexity and Space Complexity for each solution 
- Add beginner-friendly explanations 
- Appy LaTex to make it look better
- Format the code well
- Do not write comment inline with the code. Write the comment above the line instead

Template

````md
// The Meta and Problem Statement can be generated by using a Chrome extension under `converter` locally. 
// If you do not know how to do it, leave it blank and @wingkwong will help add them.

## Approach 1: <APPROACH_NAME>

// Your explanation goes here or you can add it to your code
