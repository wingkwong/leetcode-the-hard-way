## Checklist

**Ideally all of them should be checked. If you haven't fulfilled the below requirements or even delete the entire checklist, your PR won't be reviewed.**

### General 

- [ ] Make sure you've read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wingkwong/leetcode-the-hard-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
- [ ] Make sure you've followed the template format
- [ ] Make sure you've started the app locally and verified all the content and all links (if applicable) must be accessible correctly
- [ ] Make sure you've applied LaTex for variables, formulas and time / space complexity instead of using backticks
- [ ] Make sure you've formatted your code well (Code Block is rendered using `<Tabs/>`)
      Below is a C++ example. You can include multiple langs using `<TabItem/>` if necessary
      
````
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">
<SolutionAuthor name="@YOUR_ALIAS"/>

```cpp
// Your code goes here
// Prefer K&R Coding style
// See https://gist.github.com/jesseschalken/0f47a2b5a738ced9c845#why-kr for example
```

</TabItem>

````
- [ ] Make sure you've explained your code well (write comments above each line - not inline)
- [ ] Make sure you've written your explanation well and it is easy to understand for beginners
- [ ] Make sure you've included Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- [ ] Make sure you've included a meaningful approach name for your solution. Don't leave it blank. e.g. `## Approach 1: Two Pointers`.

### For Tutorial Articles

- [ ] Make sure you've explained your topic using 1 - 3 LC problems rather than using external problems. Solutions must be taken with explanations as well.
- [ ] Make sure you've provided suggested problems at the end using the given format. See [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingkwong/leetcode-the-hard-way/main/tutorials/math/number-theory/binary-exponentiation.md) as an example. If the target solution is not available, leave `solutionLink` blank.
- [ ] Make sure you've given credits / references if you use external resources. For an image, give credit under it. Otherwise, add a new section called References at the end (after Suggested Problems).
