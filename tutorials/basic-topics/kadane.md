## Overview

Kadane's algorithm is an iterative algorithm in which we search for a maximum sum contiguous subarray within 1D array.

## Algorithm

1. Store the sum of elements of the current subarray found so far. 
2. Keep updating the maximum sum of subarray found so far by checking if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far or not.
3. If the current sum is less than $0$, then we can neglect the current subarray and start a new subarray from the next element.

## Example 1: [0053 - Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

> A subarray is a contiguous part of an array maintaining the order of elements. $[1,2,3]$ is a subarray of $[1,2,3,4,5]$ but $[1,3,2]$ & $[1,3,5]$ are not.

Consider an array of positive integers only, the maximum sum subarray will be the entire array itself. If the array contains negative integers only, then the maximum sum subarray will be the maximum element of the array. 
It gets tricker when we have both positive and negative numbers. 

If the array consists of positive integers(need not be all positive integers). Then there definitely exists a subarray which has positive sum, because I can choose one positive element in worst case and it would be the subarray with positive sum. 

The main idea of Kadane's algorithm is to neglect the negative sum subarrays and take maximum among the positive sum subarrays.

        }
        // if upon adding ith element current sum is becoming less than 0
        // it cannot contribute to the maximum sum subarray so we neglect it 
        // and reset our current sum to 0 to start another subarray freshly
        if (localSum < 0) {
          localSum = 0;
        }
      }
      return globalSum;
    }

## Kadane's 2D Algorithm (Variation)

### Overview

We know about Kadane's algorithm which is a $O(N)$ algorithm that finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array. It can be extended to find maximum sum submatrix in a 2D matrix.

### Algorithm

1. Any submatrix has $4$ sides so we need $4$ variables to uniquely identify and store the boundaries of the maximum sum submatrix.
2. Using the 1D kadane's algorithm we can find the maximum sum subarray in a 1D array and with some modifications we can retrieve the boundaries(starting index and ending index) of this maximum sum subarray.
3. We need to convert the submatrix into 1D array in such a way that we can identify the boundaries of maximum sum submatrix. For this we can try fixing the left and right boundaries (finalLeft and finalRight) of the submatrix and then we calculate the cummulative sum in each row and store it as 1D array.
4. Now we can apply 1D Kadane's algorithm on this 1D array to find the maximum sum subarray and we retrieve the boundaries of this maximum sum subarray.
5. The boundaries retrieved from this 1D Kadane's algorithm are the final Top and FinalBottom boundaries of the maximum sum submatrix in the original 2D matrix.


Consider the below problem statement:

### Example 1: [0085 - Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)

> Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.              
 
```
 Input: matrix = [
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```


If noticed properly we can see that maximum sum submatrix is the 6. Which is the submatrix enclosed by zero-indexed vertices $(1,2),(1,4),(2,2),(2,4)$. 

Hint: The problem statement resonates with Kadane's algorithm. The main thing is how to extend the 1D Kadane's algorithm to 2D. General Kadane's algorithm works on a 1D array, so first we need to convert the submatrix into 1D array in such a way that we can uniquely identify the boundaries of maximum sum submatrix. Then we can apply Kadane's algorithm on this 1D array to find the maximum sum subarray.
