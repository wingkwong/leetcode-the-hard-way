## Overview

Greedy is a strategy to solve various problems optimally. A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason, greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.

Here're the rules:

- Always pick the best choice at any step.

- Works on the assumption that by picking a local optimum solution at each step we will reach a global optimum.

- The greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices.

## Example 1: [0605 - Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)


> You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
>
> Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

For a greedy solution, we would solve in such a way that we will always have the best choice at every max. Our task is to calculate maximum flowers we can plant. Its simple that if there are three consecutive zeroes then the middle one will be planted. But if we have to calculate maximum then we will miss 2 side case this way.

**Case 1: 001....**

Here intially we have just 2 consecutive zeroes but we can plant at first place. So we will consider this case too.

**Case 2: ...100**

Here at the end we have just 2 consecutive zeroes but we can plant at last place. So we will consider this case too.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int p) {
      int n = flowerbed.size();
      // count variable will calculate max flowers we can plant
      int count = 0;
      if (flowerbed[0] == 0 && n == 1) {
        count++;
      }
      // The following will cover case 1
      if (n > 1 && flowerbed[0] == 0 && flowerbed[1] == 0) {
        count++;
        flowerbed[0] = 1;
      }
      // Mid approach to check 3 consecutive zeroes
      for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 && flowerbed[i + 1] == 0) {
          flowerbed[i] = 1;
          count++;
        }
      }
      // The following will cover case 2
      if (n > 2 && flowerbed[n - 2] == 0 && flowerbed[n - 1] == 0) {
        count++;
      }
      return count >= p;
	}

## Example 2: [455 - Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)


> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
>
> Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number

This problem uses the concept of greedy. Our aim is to just assign the cookies starting from the child with less greediness to maximize the number of happy children. So we will sort greediness of child and size of cookies too. Then as soon as a child gets the cookie, we move to next child. We are using greedy in such a way that if child will less greediness cannot get a cookie, then all children with higher greediness will also not get that cookie.
